(Visual Studio Code)
The "code ." command opens VS Code in the current working folder, which becomes your "workspace". 
As you go through the tutorial, you will see three files created in a .vscode folder in the workspace:
	- tasks.json (build instructions)
	- launch.json (debugger settings)
	- c_cpp_properties.json (compiler path and IntelliSense settings)


(tasks.json)
From the main menu, choose Terminal > Configure Default Build Task. 
In the dropdown, which will display a tasks dropdown listing various predefined build tasks for C++ compilers. 
Choose g++.exe build active file, which will build the file that is currently displayed (active) in the editor.
